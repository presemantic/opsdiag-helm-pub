# OpsDiag Charts Instructions

## Purpose

This project is `opsdiag-cicd-helm-pub`: the public Helm chart repository for OpsDiag deployable artifacts.

## Structure

- [`opsdiag-app-connector/`](./opsdiag-app-connector/) contains the public Helm chart for the customer-side OpsDiag app connector.
- [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](./.github/workflows/ci.yml) packages public charts on timestamp release tags and pushes them to Artifact Registry as Helm OCI artifacts.
- Chart dependencies must use the Opsolving public chart repository and depend only on `common` from `https://github.com/opsolving/charts/tree/main/opsolving/common`.
- [`README.md`](./README.md) documents the public chart repository contents.

## Constraints

Keep chart values honest: every value added to `values.yaml` must be consumed by templates or documented as a global value consumed by the common library helpers. Do not add placeholder values that are never rendered.

Use the Bitnami-style pattern where application templates stay thin and reuse the `common` library for names, labels, image rendering, pull secrets, templated values, resources, and affinity helpers.

Do not vendor dependency charts into this repository unless explicitly requested. Dependency resolution should use Helm dependency commands against `https://opsolving.github.io/charts/`.

Chart release workflows must publish Helm OCI artifacts to `europe-west1-docker.pkg.dev/prod-common-cicd/opsdiag-helm-pub`. The `opsdiag-helm-pub` Artifact Registry repository must be an OCI/Docker-compatible repository for `helm push` and `helm install oci://...` workflows.

Charts are pushed directly to the dedicated public OpsDiag chart repository without an extra namespace segment. For example, `opsdiag-app-connector` is pushed as `europe-west1-docker.pkg.dev/prod-common-cicd/opsdiag-helm-pub/opsdiag-app-connector`.

The public connector chart renders `/app/config.yaml` from the top-level `config` value. Standard `license` and base Control edge `url` must live at the top level of `config`, while relay settings must live under `config.relay` as `license` and relay WebSocket `url` in deploy/user values, not in the public chart defaults. Do not duplicate the Control edge URL under `config.relay`, and do not include `/api/...` paths in config URLs. Do not split those values into Secrets or license-specific environment variables. The `connector` value is only for runtime tuning such as timeouts and frame limits.

The connector chart `appVersion` and default image tag track the released `opsdiag-app-connector` image tag. The release workflow must not rewrite `appVersion` to the chart release tag.

The connector chart must stay compatible with OpenShift restricted SCC. Do not set fixed `runAsUser`, `runAsGroup`, or `fsGroup` defaults; OpenShift injects a namespace-range random UID. Keep non-root, no privilege escalation, read-only root filesystem, dropped capabilities, and RuntimeDefault seccomp defaults.

The chart release workflow must not require `presemantic/actions-helpers` or `GH_ACTIONS_HELPERS_TOKEN`; it resolves timestamp release tags directly from the triggering GitHub ref.
